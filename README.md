UPennalizers

Forked from the original (c. 2019, GitLab); iterative improvements.
New code can be compiled by `cd`ing to `src/` and running `./compile start.cpp [--release/--debug]`, which creates the main executable at `bin/start`.
Legacy code can be run by `cd`ing to `legacy/Player/` and running `./game main`.

Description from the legacy codebase:

The project began with the University of Pennsylvania RoboCup code base from
the 2011 RoboCup season and is continuing to evolve into an ever more
generalized and versatile robot software framework.
